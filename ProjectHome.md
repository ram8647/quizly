Quizly is a live coding platform for [App Inventor for Android](http://appinventor.mit.edu) based on [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).  For example:

## Downloads ##

  * [Development version (10/2014)](http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/quizly-101614.tar) -- all source code and libraries.  Untarring this file (tar xvf) will create a directory named *quizly*.  To run quizly, just open *quizly/index.html*.

## Demos ##
Two separate applications are used of making and taking quizzes.  Quiz Maker generates a JSON object that can be uploaded (manually, for now) into Quizly:

  * [Example Quiz Maker](http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/quizly/makequiz.html) ([directions](UsingMakequiz.md))
  * [Example Quizzes](http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/quizly)  ([directions](UsingQuizly.md))

Quizly is self-contained and can easily be plugged into existing web sites and web applications, for example App Inventor course sites.
  * [Quizly embedded into online App Inventor lesson](http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~ram/mobilecsp)  ([how it works](EmbeddingInAWebApp.md))
  * [Quizly embedded in a Google Coursebuilder course](http://appinventor102.appspot.com) -- See Activity 4.1 and 6.1
  * [Quizly embedded in an edX Course](https://www.edx.org/course/mobile-computing-app-inventor-cs-trinityx-t002x) -- You'll need to register. 

The code is free and open source -- and there is much work to do!

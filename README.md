<h1>Quizly: A live-coding platform for App Inventor</h1>

Quizly is a live coding platform for <a target="_blank" href="appinventor.mit.edu">App Inventor</a> that is
based on <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly</a>. For example, 
here we see a quiz where the student has been asked to define a <i>fahrToCels</i> function.
Quizly runs the student's code and reports whether the function is correct or not:

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<li>Embeddable version -- code needed for deployment.

--> 

<h2>Demos</h2>

<p>Two separate applications are used for making and taking
quizzes. Quiz Maker generates a JSON object that can be uploaded
(manually, for now) into Quizly:

<li><a target="_blank" href="http://mobile-csp.org/quizly-repo/quizly/makequiz.html">Example Quiz Maker</a>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://mobile-csp.org/quizly-repo/quizly/">Example Quizzes</a>


<!-- 
<p>Quizly is self-contained and can easily be plugged into existing
web sites and web applications, for example App Inventor course
sites:

<p>The code is free and open source -- and there is much work to do!</p>

Example Quizzes (directions)
Quizly is self-contained and can easily be plugged into existing web sites and web applications, for example App Inventor course sites. * Quizly embedded into online App Inventor lesson (how it works) * Quizly embedded in Google Coursebuilder -- See Activity 4.1 and 6.1

The code is free and open source -- and there is much work to do!
